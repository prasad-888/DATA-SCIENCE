        "Hypothesis testing provides a framework for making decisions about population parameters based on sample data. Different tests like Z-tests, T-tests, Chi-square tests, and ANOVA are used based on the nature of the data and the hypothesis. The results of these tests are typically expressed in terms of the test statistic and the p-value, which help decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
